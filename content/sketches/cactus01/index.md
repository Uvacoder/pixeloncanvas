Plot points around tall + wonky arc, draw a line between each point and fill in the shape.

For every point, draw some little dots between the current point and the opposite point in the arc + a little randomness of course.

For every point, draw a randomly sized rectangle facing out from the arc and rotated at a slight random angle.

**Rotate, repeat!**

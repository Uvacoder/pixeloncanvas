Plot some number of evenly spaced points around a circle, save the coordinates for later!

Pick a random number.

Draw a line between to random points from the circle, follow that up with a bezier curve between the same two points.

Give that bezier curve a nice fill color (hopefully)

Remember that random number? **Repeat that number of times.**

Plot onto a grid!
